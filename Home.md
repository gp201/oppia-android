Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Oppia Android project, and making it easier for students to learn online in an effective and enjoyable way!

We're still working on setting up the basics of the Android project, but we are starting to welcome new contributors who'd like to help out. For now, if you're interested in contributing, please follow the following steps:

1. Sign the CLA, so that we can accept your contributions. If you're contributing as an individual, use the [individual CLA](https://goo.gl/forms/AttNH80OV0). If your company owns the copyright to your contributions, a company representative should sign the [corporate CLA](https://goo.gl/forms/xDq9gK3Zcv).
1. Fill in the [Oppia contributor survey](https://goo.gl/forms/otv30JV3Ihv0dT3C3) to let us know what your interests are. (You can always change your responses later.) Make sure to indicate prominently that you are interested in helping out with Android.
1. Check out the oppia-android codebase to become familiar with the project!
1. While the Android project infrastructure is getting set up, consider contributing to the [Oppia web app repository](https://github.com/oppia/oppia) in the meantime -- this is a good way to get familiar with our review process and some of the basic constructs in Oppia.

(As the project develops, we'll update the above instructions and reach out to active contributors when the Android project is in a sufficiently-good state to allow more participation in its development.)
