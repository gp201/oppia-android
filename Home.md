Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Oppia Android project, and making it easier for students to learn online in an effective and enjoyable way!

## Onboarding instructions
If you'd like to help out with the Android project, please follow the following steps to get started:

1. Sign the CLA, so that we can accept your contributions. If you're contributing as an individual, use the [individual CLA](https://goo.gl/forms/AttNH80OV0). If your company owns the copyright to your contributions, a company representative should sign the [corporate CLA](https://goo.gl/forms/xDq9gK3Zcv).
2. Fill in the [Oppia contributor survey](https://goo.gl/forms/otv30JV3Ihv0dT3C3) to let us know what your interests are. (You can always change your responses later.) **Make sure to indicate prominently that you are interested in helping out with Android.**
3. Download/Install the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8fX3n5Lb6AIVmH8rCh24JQsxEAAYASAAEgL4L_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds#downloads). 
4. Install **Java 8** using the links from [the Java website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).
   - **Note for Windows users:** Make sure to also set up the PATH system variable correctly for `Java`, following [these instructions](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html).
5. In Android Studio, open Tools > SDK Manager.
   - In the "SDK Platforms" tab (which is the default), select `API Level 28`.
   - Also, navigate to the "SDK Tools" tab, click the "Show Package Details" checkbox at the bottom right, then click on "Android SDK Build-Tools 31" and select 29.0.2 (this is needed for Bazel support).

   Then, click "Apply" to download and install these two SDKs/Tools.

**Note:** Make sure you have good Internet connectivity when developing on Oppia Android, since this project uses third party libraries which will be needed to build the app.

## Install oppia-android

Please follow these steps to set up Oppia Android on your local machine.

1. Create a new, empty folder called `opensource/` within your home folder. Navigate to it (`cd opensource`), then [fork and clone](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android/wiki/Fork-and-Clone-Oppia-Android) the Oppia-Android repo. This will create a new folder named `opensource/oppia-android`. Note that contributors who have write access to the repository may either create branches directly on oppia/oppia-android or use a fork.

    **Note**: Please keep the folder name as `oppia-android`. Changing the project folder name might lead to future issues with running the pre-push checks on your machine.

2. Run the setup script, which adds some development tools for Oppia Android (ktlint, checkstyle, etc.):

    - For Mac or Linux
       1. Open a terminal and navigate to `opensource/oppia-android/`.
       2. Run the script `bash scripts/setup.sh`.

    - For Mac with Apple M1 chip
       1. Locate Terminal in Finder.
       2. Right-click and create a duplicate Terminal (and rename it accordingly, say Terminal x86, to avoid confusion).
       3. In the Terminal x86, right-click and click "Get info", and check the option "Open using Rosetta".
       4. Navigate to `opensource/oppia-android/` in Rosetta.
       5. Finally, run `bash scripts/setup.sh` in Terminal x86 and all the required files should be generated. (You should see messages like `Ktlint file downloaded`, etc.)

    - For Windows
       1. Install [Git Bash Command Line](https://gitforwindows.org/)
       2. Open Git Bash Command Line.
       3. Navigate to `opensource/oppia-android/`.
       4. Run the script `bash scripts/setup.sh`.
       5. Download the [google_checks.xml](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/14005e371803bd52dff429904b354dc3e72638c0/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml) file. To do this, you can simply right-click on the `Raw` button and click on `Save Link as`.
       6. Copy this file to the directory where Git is installed (usually C:/Program Files/Git/).

3. In Android Studio, select `File > Open`, navigate to `opensource/oppia-android/`, and click `OK` to load the project.

4. Click the elephant icon in the toolbar ("Sync Gradle") to ensure that all the correct dependencies are downloaded. (In general, you'll want to do this step any time you update your dependencies.)

## Run the app from Android Studio

1. Go to Tools > AVD Manager, click "Create Virtual Device...". Then:
   - Select a preferred device definition. In general, any device is fine, but you can use Pixel 3a as a default (if you're developing for phones) or Nexus 7 (if you're developing for tablets). After selecting a device, click "Next" at the bottom right to continue.
   - Select a system image (in general, API Level 28, unless you're an M1 Mac user, in which case use API Level 29). Then click "Next".
   - Click "Finish" to complete setup.

2. To run the app, select the emulator device you want from the dropdown menu to the left of the "Run" button in the toolbar.

3. Finally, click the "Run" button.


## Installing the Oppia web app

If you need to connect to a local version of the Oppia web application, check out a copy of the [Oppia web app repository](https://github.com/oppia/oppia) and get it running locally. This will allow you to connect to a local instance of the web app when developing locally.

For now, you generally won't need to do this, until the Android app supports on-the-fly lesson downloading (which we're currently working on).


## Troubleshooting Installation

Here are some general troubleshooting tips for oppia-android. The specific platforms are Linux, Windows and Mac OS.

1. No matching toolchains (sdk_toolchain_type)
    ```
    ERROR: While resolving toolchains for target //:oppia: no matching toolchains found for types         
    @bazel_tools//tools/android:sdk_toolchain_type
    ERROR: Analysis of target '//:oppia' failed; build aborted: no matching toolchains found for types 
    @bazel_tools//tools/android:sdk_toolchain_type
    INFO: Elapsed time: 12.805s
    INFO: 0 processes.
    FAILED: Build did NOT complete successfully (13 packages loaded, 51 targets configured)
    ```
    [Steps](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/tutorial/android-app.html#integrate-with-the-android-sdk) to add ANDROID_HOME environment variable.

2. If you find any error related to `cURL`, please set up cURL on your machine. For Linux, you can use `sudo apt install curl`. No need to set up `cURL` for Windows as you are using git bash command line.<br>

3. If you find any error which says `java: command not found`, please check you have Java installed correctly in your machine and the [environment path variable](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html) is also set up correctly.

4. If you find any error related to Kotlin or Java/Checkstyle while pushing the code, please check [this link](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android/wiki/Android-Studio-UI-based-Github-workflow#how-to-fix-push-failures).

**Canâ€™t find the particular issue?**

If the error you get is not in the Troubleshooting section above, please create an issue providing all the necessary information and assign it to **@FareesHussain**.


## Instructions for making a code change

**Important:** Please read the [Oppia Android coding style guide](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android/wiki/Coding-style-guide) before making any code changes.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this free series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

*If your change isn't trivial, please [talk to us](https://gitter.im/oppia/oppia-android) before you start working on it -- this helps avoid duplication of effort, and allows us to offer advice and suggestions. For larger changes, it may be better to first create a short doc outlining a suggested implementation plan, and send it to the Android dev team for feedback.*

The following instructions describe how to make a one-off code change using a feature branch. (In case you're interested, we mainly use the [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).) Please follow them carefully, otherwise your code review may be delayed.

You might also find this reference for the [Android Studio UI-based Github workflow](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android/wiki/Android-Studio-UI-based-Github-workflow) helpful.

1. **Choose a descriptive branch name.** It should be lowercase and hyphen-separated, such as `splash-screen`. Also, it shouldn't start with `hotfix` or `release`.
2. **Before coding anything, create a new branch with this name, starting from 'develop'.** I.e., run:

    ```
      git fetch upstream
      git checkout develop
      git merge upstream/develop
      git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```

3. **Make commit(s) to your feature branch.** Each commit should be self-contained and have a descriptive commit message that helps other developers understand why the changes were made. However, **do not write "Fix #ISSUE_NUMBER"** (e.g. Fix #99999) in your commit messages, as this will cause Github to close the original issue automatically. You can rename your commit messages using `git commit --amend`.

    * Before making the commit, do some sanity-checks:
       * Start up a local instance of Oppia and do some manual testing in order to check that you haven't broken anything!
       * Ensure that your code follows the [style rules](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android/wiki/Coding-style-guide) and that it is well-tested.
       * Ensure that the code has no [lint errors](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android/wiki/Ktlint-Guide) and passes all automated tests (which will automatically run when you create your pull request).
      * Use a tool like `git diff` or `meld` to check that the changes you've made are exactly what you want them to be, and that you haven't left in anything spurious. Make sure to do this _before_ you push.

    * To actually make the commit and push it to your GitHub fork, run:

        ```
          git commit -a -m "{{YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE}}"
          git push origin {{YOUR BRANCH NAME}}
        ```

      Make sure to do this from the command line (and not GitHub's Desktop client), since this also runs some important presubmit checks before your code gets uploaded to GitHub. **If any of these checks fail, the push will be interrupted**. If this happens, fix the issues that the tests tell you about and **repeat the instructions above** ('commit' and then 'push').

4. **When your feature is ready to merge, create a pull request.**
    * Go to your fork on GitHub, select your branch from the dropdown menu, and click "pull request". Ensure that the 'base' repository is the main oppia repo (not your fork) and that the 'base' branch is 'develop'.
    * Add a descriptive title explaining the purpose of the PR (e.g. "Fix issue #bugnum: add a warning when the user leaves a page in the middle of an exploration.").
       * If the PR resolves an issue on the issue tracker, the title must start with **"Fix #bugnum: "**. This will be the case for most PRs.
       * However, if your PR fixes part of a bigger issue (e.g. the first-contributor-issues listed above), please use **"Fix part of #bugnum: "** instead. Otherwise, GitHub will close the entire issue automatically when your PR is merged.
    * Fill out the PR checklist (this shows up in the body of the PR when you create it), ensuring that your PR description includes the issue number (e.g. "This PR fixes issue #bugnum" or "This PR fixes part of issue #bugnum").
    * Click "Create pull request", then **immediately** check the "Files changed" tab on your PR on GitHub and read it carefully to make sure that the changes are correct (e.g., that you haven't left out important files that should be part of the PR. (If not, please fix this by making additional commits, or by closing this PR and submitting a new one, before requesting a review.) This is a good way to catch obvious errors that would otherwise lead to delays in the review process.
    * Request a review from the issue's "owner" **and** also set them as the PR assignee.
    * Leave a top-level comment on your PR saying "@{{reviewer}} PTAL", where {{reviewer}} is the GitHub username of your reviewer. ("PTAL" means "Please take a look".)
    * Then, wait for your code to get reviewed! While you're doing so, it's totally fine to start work on a new PR if you like. Just make sure to **checkout the develop branch** and sync to HEAD before you check out a new branch, so that each of your feature branches is based off the main trunk.

5. #### **Address review comments until all reviewers give LGTM ('looks good to me').** 
    * When your reviewer has reviewed the code, you'll get an email. You'll need to respond in two ways:
       * Make a new commit addressing the comments you agree with, and push it to the same branch. (Continue to use descriptive commit messages. If your commit addresses lots of disparate review comments, it's fine to refer to the original commit message and add something like "(address review comments)".)
          * **Always make commits locally, and then push to GitHub.** Don't make changes using the online GitHub editor -- this bypasses lint/presubmit checks, and will cause the code on GitHub to diverge from the code on your machine.
          * **Never force-push changes to GitHub, especially after reviews have started.** This will delay your review, because it overwrites history on GitHub and makes the incremental changes harder to review.
       * In addition, reply to each comment via the Files Changed tab, choosing the "Start a review" option for the first comment. Each reply should be either "Done" or a response explaining why the corresponding suggestion wasn't implemented. When you've responded to all comments, submit the review to add all your messages to the main thread. All comments must be responded to and resolved before LGTM can be given.
    * Resolve any merge conflicts that arise. To resolve conflicts between 'new-branch-name' (in your fork) and 'develop' (in the oppia repository), run:

      ```
        git checkout new-branch-name
        git fetch upstream
        git merge upstream/develop
        ...[fix the conflicts -- see https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line]...
        ...[make sure the tests pass before committing]...
        git commit -a
        git push origin new-branch-name
      ```
    * Once you've finished addressing everything, and would like the reviewer to take another look:
       * Start a dev server in order to make sure that everything still works.
       * Check that the changes in the "Files Changed" tab are what you intend them to be.
       * **Write a top-level comment** explicitly asking the reviewer to take another look (e.g. "@XXX PTAL"), and set them as the assignee for the PR.
    * At the end, the reviewer will merge the pull request.

6. **Tidy up!** After the PR status has changed to "Merged", delete the feature branch from both your local clone and the GitHub repository:

     ```
       git branch -D new-branch-name
       git push origin --delete new-branch-name
     ```

7. **Celebrate.** Congratulations, you have contributed to the Oppia Android project!

### Notes

* Our central development branch is `develop`, which should be clean and ready for release at any time. All changes should be done in feature branches based off of `develop`.

* To find the author of a particular change in a file, run this command:

  ```
  git blame file-name
  ```
  The output will show the latest commit SHA, author, date, and time of commit for each line.

  To confine the search of an author between particular lines in a file, you can use:

  ```
  git blame -L 40,60 file-name
  ```
  The output will then show lines 40 to 60 of the particular file.

  For more `git blame` options, you can visit the [git blame documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame).

* If your PR includes changing the location of the file, if you simply move the file by cut and paste method, then the git will track it as a new file. So to prevent this, use:
  ```
  git mv old_file_path new_file_path
  ```
  By using this command git will detect the file as a renamed file.
