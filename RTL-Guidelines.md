# Testing app for RTL Layouts
To test any screen for RTL language follow these steps:
1. Enable [`Developer Options`](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) on your device.
2. Set language to `Arabic [XB]` or `cibarA [XB]` with the help of this [link](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/pseudolocales).

Make this language as primary language and now open the oppia app. You will notice that all characters appear from right-to-left similar to what `Arabic` languages follow.
