## Overview
Accessibility is an important part of Oppia to ensure that the app is accessible by everyone. Some common conditions that affect a person's use of an Android device are:
* blindness / low vision
* deafness / impaired hearing
* cognitive disabilities
* confined motor skills
* color blindness, etc.

Making sure that the Oppia app is accessible by all resonates with overall Oppia's mission: **to help anyone learn anything they want in an effective and enjoyable way.**

Note: In short we can write Accessibility as **A11Y**.
